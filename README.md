### Introduction

This repository contains codes for Adi-Red approach proposed in the paper [From Volcano to Toyshop: Adaptive Discriminative Region
Discovery for Scene Recognition](). This approach achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of Top-1 classification accuracy on the scene benchmark [SUN397](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/SUN/). By deriving discriminative information directly from a CNN classifier, which was pre-trained using only image-level scene labels, Adi-Red can efficienly discover local discriminative image patches and integrate them with the global-scale image features in a multi-scale feature aggegation pipeline.

**Note**

The main code file titled "DisMap_generation_per_image.py" is written with PyTorch in python 3.6, and another file titled "Discover_patches_per_image.m" is written with MATLAB.

### Results

1. We use the multi-scale deep features generated by our approach to train a linear SVM classifier with parameter C fixed for all the     implementations.
Top-1 accuracy on SUN397: 

	Networks|Baseline|Adi-Red
	:---:|:---:|:---:
	AlexNet|54.17%|61.01%
	ResNet-18|66.96%|70.58%
	ResNet-50|71.38%|73.59%
	
2. Visualization of discriminative patches (smallest-scale) discovered by Adi-Red on Places365-Standard validation set. Specially, some patches (from "airfield", "bathroom" and "Japanese garden") convey object-level information. Other patches (from "baseball field" and "campsite") capture contextual semantics, i.e., the interaction between object parts and their surroundings. In another case, non-objectness patterns are captured successfully for the scenes (such as "crosswalk" and "beach"), where finding nameable objects (for example, people and cars in the crosswalk scene) based on region proposals is redundant and might even introduce confusion instead of contributing to their discriminative properties.

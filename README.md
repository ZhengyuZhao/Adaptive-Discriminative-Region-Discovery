### Introduction

This repository contains codes for Adi-Red approach described in the paper [From Volcano to Toyshop: Adaptive Discriminative Region
Discovery for Scene Recognition](). This approach achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of Top-1 classification accuracy on the scene benchmark [SUN397](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/SUN/), by discovering discriminative local image patches efficiently. 

**Note**

The codes include PyTorch scripts in python 3.6, and Matlab scripts written with the version MATLAB 2016b.

### Results

1. Visualization of discriminative patches (smallest-scale) discovered by Adi-Red on Places365-Standard validation set. Specially, some patches (from "airfield", "bathroom" and "Japanese garden") convey object-level information. Other patches (from "baseball field" and "campsite") capture contextual semantics, i.e., the interaction between object parts and their surroundings. In another case, non-objectness patterns are captured successfully for the scenes (such as "crosswalk" and "beach"), where finding nameable objects (for example, people and cars in the crosswalk scene) based on region proposals is redundant and might even introduce confusion instead of contributing to their discriminative properties.

2. We use the multi-scale deep features generated by our approach to train a linear SVM classifier with parameter C fixed for all the     implementations.
